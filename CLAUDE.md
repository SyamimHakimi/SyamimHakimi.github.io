# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start Astro dev server
npm run build        # Type-check + Astro build
npm run preview      # Preview production build locally
npm run lint         # ESLint with auto-fix
npm run test         # Run Vitest unit tests
npm run type-check   # TypeScript validation only
npm run deploy       # Build + deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run ui:preview   # Screenshot an HTML mockup and send to Syamim's Telegram
                     # Usage: npm run ui:preview -- --file scripts/mockup.html --label "Title"
node --env-file=.env scripts/firestore-export.mjs  # Re-export Firestore data (Phase A1, one-time)
                     # Requires GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS in .env pointing to service account JSON
```

## Architecture

This is an **Astro 6 + TypeScript personal portfolio website** deployed to GitHub Pages.
It uses a static-first, island architecture — the site shell is built at deploy time;
all content is read from Firebase Firestore at runtime via Vue islands, so any change
in Firebase appears on the live site immediately without redeployment.

**Core Stack:**
- Astro 6 (static site generator, island architecture)
- TypeScript (strict mode enabled in Phase A7 hardening)
- Tailwind CSS 4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite`)
- Vue 3 (Composition API — islands only, not the site shell)
- Firebase Firestore (all content — runtime reads via Vue islands, no build-time fetch)
- Firebase SDK v10+ (modular, tree-shakeable; Firestore + Auth)
- Zod (runtime schema validation — all Firestore payloads validated before reaching UI)
- lucide-vue-next (tree-shakeable icons)
- motion-v (scroll-triggered animations, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`)
- EmailJS (contact form, client-side only)
- ApexCharts + vue3-apexcharts (photography statistics charts)
- Vitest + @vue/test-utils (unit testing)

## Data Model

There are **no Astro content collections**. All content is stored in Firebase Firestore
and read at runtime by Vue islands. Syamim can update any content in the Firebase console
and it will appear on the site immediately — no redeployment required.

Firestore data is accessed exclusively through composables in `src/lib/composables/`.
TypeScript interfaces for all data models live alongside their composables.

| Composable          | Firestore Collection(s)                                           | Consumed by                |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `useStatistics()`   | `statistics`                                                      | `PhotographyJourney.vue`   |
| `useGallery()`      | `photos`                                                          | `GalleryGrid.vue`, `GalleryLightbox.vue` |
| `usePortfolio()`    | `experience/{platforms,protocols,frameworks,languages}/item`, `projects/XYdqe9OyXNSUEzZ8kqwn` (singleton + `techstack` subcollection) | `PortfolioSection.vue`     |
| `useServices()`     | `services`                                                        | `ServicesSection.vue`      |
| `useAboutMe()`      | `profile/ddIhV8IxV5DjciJY7UxW` (singleton), `photography-gears`, `favourite-boardgames`, `social-media` | `AboutMe.vue`         |

The `export/` directory is a one-time Phase A1 archive of Firestore data (JSON snapshots).
It is **read-only after Phase A1** and is never read at runtime or build time.

## Vue Islands

Vue is used **only** where a feature requires client state, browser APIs, or a
third-party interactive library. Every island reads its own data from Firestore.
The rule: no Vue island unless genuinely needed.

| Island                    | Directive        | Composable          | Reason                                  |
|---------------------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `PhotographyJourney.vue`  | `client:visible` | `useStatistics()`   | ApexCharts needs browser canvas         |
| `GalleryGrid.vue`         | `client:visible` | `useGallery()`      | Paginated state + Firestore reads       |
| `GalleryLightbox.vue`     | `client:visible` | —                   | Interactive image viewer (browser APIs) |
| `PortfolioSection.vue`    | `client:visible` | `usePortfolio()`    | Runtime Firestore reads                 |
| `ServicesSection.vue`     | `client:visible` | `useServices()`     | Runtime Firestore reads                 |
| `AboutMe.vue`             | `client:visible` | `useAboutMe()`      | Runtime Firestore reads                 |
| `ContactForm.vue`         | `client:load`    | —                   | EmailJS requires browser fetch          |
| `ThemeToggle.vue`         | `client:load`    | —                   | Reads/writes localStorage on mount      |

## Data Flow

All content flows: Firebase Firestore → Vue island composable → rendered UI (runtime).

No content is fetched at build time. Astro pages are pure structural shells — they mount
Vue islands but perform no data fetching themselves.

Theme persists to `localStorage` (key: `theme`). `BaseLayout.astro` includes an inline
`<script>` in `<head>` that reads `localStorage.theme` and sets `data-theme="dark"` on
`<html>` before first paint to prevent a flash of wrong theme. `ThemeToggle.vue` then
manages subsequent toggles. All dark-mode CSS must use `[data-theme="dark"]` as the selector.

Tailwind's `dark:` variant must be wired to this attribute in `src/styles/global.css`:
```css
@custom-variant dark (&:where([data-theme=dark], [data-theme=dark] *));
```
Without this override, Tailwind defaults to `prefers-color-scheme` and `dark:` utilities
will not respond to the `data-theme` attribute toggle.

## Routing

All routes are real URL paths (no hash routing). Astro generates static HTML for each
page at build time. The default route `/` is the Photography Journey landing page (`src/pages/index.astro`).
The full gallery lives at `/photography` (`src/pages/photography.astro`).

## Environment Variables

Astro exposes env vars to the client only if prefixed with `PUBLIC_`. Server-only vars
have no prefix and are never sent to the browser.

| Prefix    | Accessible in          | Example                          |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `PUBLIC_` | Client (Vue islands)   | `PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`      |
| *(none)*  | Server / build time only | `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` |

Required vars are documented in `.env.example`.
Firebase client config (public API keys) lives in `src/lib/firebase.ts` — safe to commit.
Do not use the old `VITE_APP_` prefix; it is not the Astro convention.

## Testing

Vitest is configured in `vitest.config.ts`. Tests live alongside source files as
`*.test.ts` / `*.test.vue` or under `src/__tests__/`.

Run `npm test` before marking any phase REVIEW READY.

## Deployment

GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Astro builds to `dist/` with
`output: 'static'` and the `site` + `base` config set for GitHub Pages.
